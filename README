This is a Hello World project in Nancy web framework, using WebMatrix as a dev environment.

The first goal is to set up a lightweight stack build around WebMatrix with Nancy, Simple.Data,
Spark View Engine and more (if needed)...

The second goal is to be able to use that stack as a reference implementation when building small 
quick apps or sites that can be easily git-deployed in a cloud PaaS hosting environment like Moncai or AppHarbor.
