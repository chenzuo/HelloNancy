This is a Hello World project in Nancy web framework, using WebMatrix as a dev environment.

The first goal is to set up a lightweight stack build around WebMatrix with Nancy, Simple.Data,
Spark View Engine and more (if needed)...

The second goal is to be able to use that stack for to build small quick apps that will be
deployed in a cloud PaaS hosting environment like Moncai or AppHarbor.
